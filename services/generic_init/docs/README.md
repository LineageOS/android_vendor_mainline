# generic_init

An init program for devices that cannot describe their hardware in
advance. It is a fork of AOSP `system/core/init` with extra features.

**TL;DR:** `generic_init` runs as the first process in the ramdisk. It
loads modules, discovers block devices as they appear, builds the
fstab on the fly, mounts Android, and then hands over to the normal
AOSP `/system/bin/init`.

## What it is

| Fact | Value |
|------|-------|
| Based on | AOSP `system/core/init` at tag `android-17.0.0_r1` |
| Lives in | `vendor/mainline/services/generic_init` |
| Binary name | `generic_init` (stem of the modules below) |
| Runs as | `rdinit=/system/bin/generic_init` in the ramdisk, or in recovery |
| Replaces | AOSP `init_first_stage` and the first stage mount |
| Includes | A copy of `ueventd`, wired into the boot sequence |
| Does not replace | The second stage: `/system/bin/init` still runs as usual |

## What it adds to AOSP init

| Feature | Where |
|---------|-------|
| Block device discovery and fstab generation | `dynamic_mount_handler.cpp` |
| Mounting with system-as-root and overlayfs | `dynamic_mount_helpers.cpp` |
| ueventd running inside first stage init, with exit conditions | `ueventd.cpp` |
| Module loading by prefix list, from ramdisk and from vendor | `first_stage_init.cpp` |
| `vendor_init` hook before the real init | `first_stage_init.cpp` |
| Property expansion from `androidboot.*` while parsing `.rc` | `util.cpp` |
| First stage console from `/vendor/bin/bootstrap/sh` | `first_stage_console.cpp` |
| Pause on fatal error, for reading logs | `reboot_utils.cpp` |
| Delay before loading each module, for finding crashers | `modalias_handler.cpp` |
